A little tip if you try it out online - there are [128 original mooncat pixel drawings / designs](https://github.com/cryptocopycats/awesome-mooncatrescue-bubble/blob/master/DESIGNS.md)
(all encoded in the original source code in a single-line string - see [`designs.rb`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptocopycats/mooncats/master/lib/mooncats/designs.rb) for a "word-wrapped" more readable
source of the original example.

Yes, you can read in the design into the pixel drawing tool online  (reformat required - every pixel row must be on its own line
and all (color) numbers space separated).
